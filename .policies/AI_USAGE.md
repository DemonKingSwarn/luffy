## luffy AI usage policy

We recognize the usefulness and technological progress of AI models for
software development. However, it is much needed to set boundaries
for how those tools may and may not be used across the hyprland ecosystem.

## Acceptable Use

This is a _whitelist_, which means if your use is not explicitly
allowed here, it is forbidden.

Acceptable uses of AI include:
- Summarizing code and/or documentation for learning purposes.
- Locally writing patches and/or new features, tests, etc.

### Keep your AI on the leash

An AI model must not submit, write the description of, or in any other
way interact with Pull Requests, Issues, or any other developer-facing
communication channel.

### Be responsible

All in all, **you** are still responsible for your code, the human. If
there is no human in the chain, your submission is invalid.

Make **sure** to review your code and read through it so that you understand
it. If you don't, do **not** submit it. You can use it for your own purposes,
but we don't want to waste our time on doing all the work for you.

## Penalties and punishments

For minor offenses, e.g. submitting code you do not fully understand,
we may let you off with a warning.

For major offenses, e.g. a fully autonomous AI agent, AI-generated PR descriptions,
AI-generated tickets, we will be issuing permanent bans without questions.
